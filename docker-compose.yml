# A 2-node OpenSearch cluster with account admin/T!mberW0lf#92,
# an OpenSearch Dashboards node,
# a filebeat node
# and a loggenerator node that generates logs using Serilog.
# Not using latest tags for the OpenSearch images because at the moment
# 2.16.0 does not load the Discover page on Firefox (no idea why), so we're using 2.15.0
# which does work properly.
