# Docker structured logging using Filebeat and OpenSearch

This repo shows a demo how to do structured logging from a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.
The structured logging is picked up by [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/filebeat) and
sent to [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) to be stored.
The data can then be searched and visualized with [OpenSearch Dashboards](https://www.opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/).
